(2, 'George Orwell', 'http://www.george-orwell.org/', 'Eric Arthur Blair (25 June 1903 – 21 January 1950), known by his pen name George Orwell, was an English novelist and journalist. His work is marked by clarity, intelligence and wit, awareness of social injustice, opposition to totalitarianism, and belief in democratic socialism.<br>\n<br>\nConsidered perhaps the 20th century\'s best chronicler of English culture, Orwell wrote literary criticism, poetry, fiction and polemical journalism. He is best known for the dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) and the allegorical novella Animal Farm (1945), which together have sold more copies than any two books by any other 20th-century author. His book Homage to Catalonia (1938), an account of his experiences in the Spanish Civil War, is widely acclaimed, as are his numerous essays on politics, literature, language and culture. In 2008, The Times ranked him second on a list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\".<br>\n<br>\nOrwell\'s work continues to influence popular and political culture, and the term Orwellian — descriptive of totalitarian or authoritarian social practices — has entered the vernacular with several of his neologisms, such as doublethink, thoughtcrime, Big Brother and thought police.'),

(1, 1, 'The Handmaid\'s Tale', 'The Handmaid\'s Tale.jpg', '<p>The Handmaid\'s Tale is a dystopian novel first published in 1985. It is set in a near-future New England, in a totalitarian, Christian theonomy that has overthrown the United States government. The novel focuses on the journey of the handmaid Offred. Her name derives from the possessive form \"of Fred\", meaning slave of Fred: handmaids are forbidden to use their birth names and must echo the male, or master, whom they serve. The novel\'s title refers to Geoffrey Chaucer\'s The Canterbury Tales, a series of connected stories (\"The Merchant\'s Tale\", \"The Parson\'s Tale\", etc.). In Atwood\'s book Offred\'s tale connects the other handmaids\' tales. The \'night\' sections are solely about Offred, the other sections (shopping, waiting room, household, etc.) narrate any handmaid\'s life, though from the perspective of Offred. Offred as the narrator jumps between past and present as she tells the present and retells the events leading up to the fall of women\'s rights.</p>\n\n<p>The Handmaid\'s Tale won the first Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1987; it was nominated for the 1986 Nebula Award, the 1986 Booker Prize, and the 1987 Prometheus Award. The book has been adapted into a 1990 film, a 2000 opera, and a 2017 television series which is currently in its second season.</p>'),

Subsequently two young boars, Snowball and Napoleon, prepare the animals for a revolution, \"All animals are equal\" is the final among 7 \'Commandments of Animalism\'. The animals drive the drunken farmer Jones away. <br>\nThe pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set milk and apples aside for themselves. Snowball, with varying success, teaches the animals to read and write while Napoleon grows himself a guard of dogs. Jones comes back with a gun and men but the animals put the humans to flight. The heroes of this battle are Snowball and Boxer, the great workhorse.<br>\nPolitical differences between Snowball and Napoleon come to a head when Snowball almost wins a vote on his pet windmill project. Napoleon brings in the dogs who attack Snowball and drive him off. Afterwards, to everyone\'s astonishment, the windmill is to be built after all. When the animals find the windmill collapsed after a storm, Napoleon and his helper Squealer convince the animals that the absent Snowball has sabotaged their project.<br>\nNapoleon has animals killed for alleged collaboration with the infamous Snowball, and \'Beasts of England\' is abolished because, in Squealers words, since \"the Rebellion is now completed ... Clearly this song has no longer any purpose\". When anyone appears dissatisfied, he will cry: \"Surely there is no one among you who wants to see Jones come back?\"<br>\nThe animals work very hard on the farm especially Boxer, who has always been too popular for Napoleon\'s taste. When the big horse finally collapses, the pigs get a van from the abattoir that they say is from a medical clinic. The smart donkey Benjamin reads the lettering on the side of the van when it is already driving off. Boxer tries to smash his way out but he is now too weak.<br>\nYears pass, and the pigs start to resemble humans more and more. The Seven Commandments are reduced and altered to a single phrase: \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\".\n</p>\n\n<p>Animal Farm is an allegorical novel, first published in August 1945. According to Orwell, the book reflects events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and then on into the Stalin era in the Soviet Union. In his essay \"Why I Write\" (1946), he wrote that Animal Farm was the first book in which he had tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, \"to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole\". Orwell wrote the book from November 1943 – February 1944, when the wartime alliance with the Soviet Union was at its height. It was initially rejected by a number of British and American publishers.</p>'),

It can be burned in the garden, thrown in the river or handed over to the Memory Police. Soon enough, the island forgets it ever existed.\n\nWhen a young novelist discovers that her editor is in danger of being taken away by the Memory Police, she desperately wants to save him. For some reason, he doesn’t forget, and it’s becoming increasingly difficult for him to hide his memories.

(4, 2, '1984', '1984.jpg', 'Nineteen Eighty-Four is a dystopian novel by George Orwell published in 1949. The Oceanian province of Airstrip One (formerly known as Great Britain) is a world of perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, and public mind control, dictated by a political system euphemistically named English Socialism (Ingsoc) under the control of a privileged Inner Party elite that persecutes all individualism and independent thinking as thoughtcrimes. Their tyranny is headed by Big Brother, the quasi-divine Party leader who enjoys an intense cult of personality, but who may not even exist. Big Brother and the Party justify their rule in the name of a supposed greater good. The protagonist of the novel, Winston Smith, is a member of the Outer Party who works for the Ministry of Truth (Minitrue), which is responsible for propaganda and historical revisionism. His job is to re-write past newspaper articles so that the historical record always supports the current party line. Smith is a diligent and skillful worker, but he secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion against Big Brother.\n<br><br>\nAs literary political fiction and dystopian science-fiction, Nineteen Eighty-Four is a classic novel in content, plot, and style. Many of its terms and concepts, such as Big Brother, doublethink, thoughtcrime, Newspeak, Room 101, Telescreen, 2 + 2 = 5, and memory hole, have entered everyday use since its publication in 1949. Moreover, Nineteen Eighty-Four popularised the adjective Orwellian, which describes official deception, secret surveillance, and manipulation of the past by a totalitarian or authoritarian state. In 2005, the novel was chosen by TIME magazine as one of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005. It was awarded a place on both lists of Modern Library 100 Best Novels, reaching number 13 on the editor\'s list, and 6 on the reader\'s list. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 8 on the BBC\'s survey The Big Read.'),
(5, 1, 'The Blind Assassin', 'The Blind Assassin.jpg', 'The Blind Assassin is an award-winning, bestselling novel by the Canadian author Margaret Atwood. It was first published by McClelland and Stewart in 2000. Set in Canada, it is narrated from the present day, referring back to events that span the twentieth century.<br>\n<br>\nThe work was awarded the Man Booker Prize in 2000 and the Hammett Prize in 2001. It was also nominated for Governor General\'s Award in 2000, Orange Prize for Fiction, and the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award in 2002. Time Magazine named it the best novel of 2000 and included it in its list of the 100 greatest English-language novels since 1923.<br>\n<br>\nThe novel centres on the protagonist, Iris Chase, and her sister Laura, who committed suicide shortly after the Second World War ended. Iris, now an old woman, recalls the events and relationships of her childhood, youth and middle age, as well as her unhappy marriage to Richard Griffen, a rival of her industrialist father. Interwoven into the novel is a story within a story, a roman à clef attributed to Laura and published by Iris about Alex Thomas, a politically radical author of pulp science fiction who has an ambiguous relationship with the sisters. That novel itself contains a story within a story, the eponymous Blind Assassin, a science fiction story told by Alex\'s fictional counterpart to that novel\'s protagonist, believed to be Laura\'s fictional counterpart.<br>\n<br>\nThe novel takes the form of a gradual revelation, illuminating both Iris\' youth and her old age before coming to the pivotal events of her and Laura\'s lives around the time of the Second World War. As the novel unfolds, and the novel-within-a-novel becomes ever more obviously inspired by real events, it is revealed that Iris, not Laura, is the novel-within-a-novel\'s true author and protagonist. Though the novel-within-a-novel had long been believed to be inspired by Laura\'s romance with Alex, it is revealed that The Blind Assassin was written by Iris based on her extramarital affair with Alex. She later published the work in Laura\'s name after Laura committed suicide upon learning of their affair. The novel ends with Iris posthumously leaving the truth to be discovered in the form of an unpublished autobiography left to her sole surviving granddaughter.<br>\n<br>\nThe book is set in the fictional Ontario town of Port Ticonderoga and in the Toronto of the 1930s and 1940s. It is a work of historical fiction with the major events of Canadian history forming an important backdrop to the novel. Greater verisimilitude is given through a series of newspaper articles that comment on events and on the novel\'s characters from a distance.');
